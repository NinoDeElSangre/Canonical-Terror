<h1 style="color:GhostWhite;">A test run for my own website.</h1>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">Probably just an empty place at the moment. Eventually, I'll be able to get more things onto the site.<p>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">Click <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c7/7e/dd/c77edd27109059eb34608b6ab1623636.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> for some magic.<p>

<p style="color:GhostWhite;">I originally made this site for the purpose of possibly promoting my art and anything relating to what I want to accomplish later in life. Perhaps once I get a better understanding of this program and grasping more ideas from this sudo frankenstein's monster.<p>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">What I create with this site will be interesting. If people are interested in contacting me in regards of developing sites. Message my alternative Discord, SwordBlade#2196!<p>

<p style="color:GhostWhite;">I'm hoping to enter images of my art and further push my commissions through.<p>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">This site will be updated very soon as I now have the resources to accept commissions and create art requested by the buyer!<p>
